## Introduction
This project aims to build a complete pipeline for face detection and image augmentation. The pipeline involves several stages, from data collection and annotation to model training and real-time detection. By combining these stages, the project enables the development of a face detection system that can augment images in real-time.

## Objectives
- **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse set of images for training and testing the face detection model.
- **Annotation**: Label the images with bounding boxes around faces to create a dataset suitable for training.
- **Augmentation**: Apply various image augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset and improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model to detect faces using TensorFlow.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Implement real-time face detection using a webcam or live video feed.

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Capture images using a webcam or camera and save them for annotation.
2. **Annotation**: Use tools like LabelMe to annotate the images, creating JSON files with face bounding boxes.
3. **Augmentation**: Apply augmentation techniques to increase the variability of the dataset and improve model robustness.
4. **Model Training**: Build and train a neural network model to detect faces in images.
5. **Real-Time Detection**: Deploy the trained model to detect faces in real-time video feeds.

## Setup
To get started with this project, you need to set up your development environment. Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, LabelMe, Albumentations

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install labelme tensorflow tensorflow-gpu opencv-python matplotlib albumentations
```

## Data Collection
Images are collected using a webcam or camera. The collected images are saved in a directory for subsequent annotation. 

## Annotation
Images are annotated using LabelMe, a tool for creating labeled datasets. The annotations include bounding boxes around faces, saved in JSON files.

## Augmentation Pipeline
The augmentation pipeline enhances the dataset by applying transformations such as cropping, flipping, and adjusting brightness. This step is crucial for increasing the diversity of the training data and improving the model's ability to generalize.

## Model Training
A deep learning model is built using TensorFlow to detect faces in images. The model is trained on both original and augmented datasets to learn to identify faces with high accuracy.

## Real-Time Detection
The trained model is deployed for real-time face detection. This involves capturing live video from a webcam, processing each frame through the model, and displaying the detected faces with bounding boxes.

## Conclusion
The Face Detection and Augmentation Pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for face detection and image augmentation. By following this pipeline, users can develop a robust face detection system that can be applied to various real-world scenarios.
